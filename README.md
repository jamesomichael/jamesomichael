## Hello, I'm James! ðŸ‘‹

With six years of industry experience, I specialise in web development and have worked with a range of languages, frameworks, and tools throughout my career.

My background is primarily backend-focused, with particular emphasis on JavaScript/Node.js and databases. Recently, I've been delving deeper into the frontend world, gaining experience with technologies like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. [Check out my work!](https://jamesmichael.dev)
